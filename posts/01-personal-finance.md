Recently three persons asked me to list some budgeting apps and spreadsheets so I decided to take a trip down memory lane to some of the tools I've used over the years.

The things I want out of a personal finance tool are:

- The ability to use multiple currencies.
- Monthly Balance & Visualization
- Monthly Balance with Forecasting and Visualization
- Weekly Expense Prediction
- Reoccuring transactions
- Periodic Expense Report Breakdown
- Be customisable as my financial needs grow.

I would ultimately love to connect to an API to automate handling expenses, but one of my two local Jamaican banks does not even allow me to download a CSV file so that dream is a long way off. Scotiabank does allow me to download a pdf (without properly formatted tables) so I need a tool to make the rest of my finance record keeping as painless as possible.

I started off like most persons with a google sheet or excel generated template that has no marcos to automate the process of clearing the sheet monthly and recording that data elsewhere. Once I crossed that bridge, I realised I just hated entering data into a spreadsheet.

#  MoneyLover

[Moneylover](https://moneylover.me/), made by Vietnamese company Finsify Co Ltd, is available for [Web](https://web.moneylover.me/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id486312413) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookmark.money) is the first app I ever bought. The cute visuals and the ability to connect to my Paypal account to automate my expense handling is what drew me in its web.

Unfortunately, I do not remember why I stopped using it. It seems pretty solid in my re-checking of the tool for this article.

## Features I wanted
- Monthly Balance & Visualization
- Weekly Expense Prediction

## Extra Features
- Synchronise between multiple devices.
- Multiple currencies.
- Add recurring transactions.
- Keep track of a savings plan.
- Manage debts and loans.
- Reports
- Expense budget envelopes
- Scan recipts and auto-process them.
- Not able to access some savings & some other accounts in the web app.

# Aspire budgeting

[Aspire budgeting](https://aspirebudget.com/) is a google spreadsheet that I came across because of its [reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/).  This community has Andriod and iOS apps to make data entry a little easier, however, the voluntary developer who made these apps took a step back recently so [the iOS  app may not be available anymore.](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/comments/v78yir/time_to_say_goodbye/)

At the time that I used it, someone had posted an app script to create recurring transactions, but the appears that creator of Aspire budget has added it to [G suite add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/aspire_budgeting/591997494881) that extends the functionality of the sheet. 

## Feature Must Have         
- Multiple Currencies
- Recurring transact Beancount

I started off with beancount because of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plug-in called [Ledger-obsidian](https://github.com/tgrosinger/ledger-obsidian). I could not for the life of my get that plug-in to work so I read around the internet for a bit and decided to just use the original [ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger) from the cli as intended. I found it a little counterintuitive and that led me to beancount and fava!

[Fava](https://fava.pythonanywhere.com/example-beancount-file/income_statement/) is a web interface for beancount making it easier to visualize your finance. The best part is that fava and beancount are both written in Python and therefore easily extended to fit my needs.

## What is beancount?

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial transaction records in a text file, read them in memory, generate a variety of reports from them, and provides a web interface.

It's in a style that is similar to ledger. You may want to check out the [reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/) or the [plaintextaccounting website](https://plaintextaccounting.org/).
