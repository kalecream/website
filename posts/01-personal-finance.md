Recently three persons asked me to list some budgeting apps and spreadsheets so I decided to take a trip down memory lane to some of the tools I've used over the years.

The things I want out of a personal finance tool are:

- Monthly Balance Visualization
- Monthly Balance Prediction
- Weekly Expense Prediction
- Periodic Expense Report Breakdown
- Be customisable as I decide which financial metrics I need.

I would ultimately love to connect to an API to automate handling expenses, but one of my two local Jamaican banks does not even allow me to download a CSV file so that dream is a long way off. Scotiabank does allow me to download a pdf (without properly formatted tables) so I need a tool to make the rest of my finance record keeping as painless as possible.

I started off like most persons with a google sheet or excel generated template that has no marcos to automate the process of clearing the sheet monthly and recording that data elsewhere. Once I crossed that bridge, I realised I just hated entering data into a spreadsheet.

[Moneylover](https://moneylover.me/), made by Vietnamese company Finsify Co Ltd, is available for [Web](https://web.moneylover.me/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id486312413) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookmark.money) is the first app I ever bought. The cute visuals and the ability to connect to my Paypal account to automate my expense handling is what drew me in its web.

Unfortunately, I do not remember why I stopped using it. It seems pretty solid in my re-checking of the tool for this article.

# Aspire budgeting

[Aspire budgeting](https://aspirebudget.com/) is a google spreadsheet that I came across because of its [reddit community](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/).  This community has Andriod and iOS apps to make data entry a little easier, however, the voluntary developer who made these apps took a step back recently so [the iOS  app may not be available anymore.](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspirebudgeting/comments/v78yir/time_to_say_goodbye/)

At the time that I used it, someone had posted an app script to create recurring transactions, but the appears that creator of Aspire budget has added it to [G suite add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/aspire_budgeting/591997494881) that extends the functionality of the sheet. 

## Feature Must Have         
- Multiple Currencies
- Recurring transactions
